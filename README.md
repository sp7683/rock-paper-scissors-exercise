## Repo Setup

After cloning the repo, navigate there from the command-line:

Example: 

```
cd ~/Desktop/rock-paper-scissors-exercise
```

After setting up a virtual environment, we will be ready to run this file.

## Environment Setup

NOTE: if you want, you could do this exercise in the "base" environment! Otherwise, for more practice, we could use a project-specific environment.

Create and activate a new project-specific Anaconda virtual environment:

```
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)

conda activate my-game-env
```

From within the virtual environment, run the Python script from the command-line.

## Running the Game

Here's a shell command/terminal command to play the game:
```sh
python game.py
```

If you see the "Welcome 'Player One' to Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" message, you're ready to play the game. 

There are no packages needed to install using pip. 

## Game Instructions

1. Player should select Rock, Paper, or Scissors (not case sensitive). An invalid entry will quit the game. 
2. Computer will make a selection
3. Game results will be displayed
